## Overview

I am a Web Developer focused on building modern, fast, and user-friendly websites. This project showcases my work using ONCE UI as a foundation for creating flexible and highly customizable web interfaces, developed with Next.js and closely aligned with modern design workflows.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For building performant, server-rendered React applications.
- **React**: As the core library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **ONCE UI**: As the base design system for consistent UI patterns.
- **Clerk**: For authentication and complete user management.
- **Convex**: The backend platform that keeps your app in sync.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was finding the right balance between customization and consistency. By defining clear design tokens and component boundaries, I was able to keep the system flexible without sacrificing visual coherence. This project also strengthened my understanding of how design systems can significantly improve development speed and maintainability.
## Outcome

The result is a solid foundation for building modern websites quickly and efficiently. The system enables faster development, consistent UI across pages, and a smoother collaboration between design and development—reflecting my approach and growth as a Web Developer.
